                Computers are machines that <b> perform tasks or calculations
                according to a set of instructions,</b>or programs.
                The first fully electronic computers, introduced
                in the 1940s, were<strong>huge machines that required
                teams of people to operate.</strong> to those early
                machines, today's computers are amazing. Not only are
                they thousands of times faster, they can fit on your
                desk,<i>on your lap, or even in your pocket.</i>Computers work
                through an interaction of hardware and software. Hardware
                refers to the<em>parts of a computer that you can see and touch,
                including the case</em>and everything inside it.

                <u><b>The most important piece of hardware is a tiny rectangular chip
                inside your computer called the central processing unit (CPU),
                or microprocessor.</b></u> It's the "brain" of your computerâ€”the part
                that translates instructions and performs calculations. Hardware
                items such as your monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, and other
                components are often called hardware devices, or devices. Software
                refers to the instructions, or programs, that tell the hardware
                what to do. A <strike>word-processing program</strike> that you can use to write
                letters on your computer is a type of software. <br> The operating
                system (OS) is software that manages your computer and the devices
                connected to it. <br> Windows is a well-known operating system.
